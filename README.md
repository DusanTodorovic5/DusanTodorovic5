## Hi, I'm Dušan Todorović :wave:

* **Current Focus:** GPU-driven development and low-latency systems.
* **Background:** Ex-BlackRock (FinTech) & HFT startup experience.
* **Philosophy:** Pragmatic, TDD-driven, and fascinated by hardware acceleration. Deeply influenced by Stoicism and Absurdism.
* **Tech Stack:** `C++`, `C#`, `C`, `DirectX/Vulkan`, and currently exploring `Rust` 🦀.
* **Offline:** If you can't reach me, I’m likely on my BMW oilhead bike traversing Europe or Asia. When the bike is resting, I’m usually oil painting or playing guitar.

ps. Sometimes I play with local AI generation and LoRA training using an Intel Arc A770.
